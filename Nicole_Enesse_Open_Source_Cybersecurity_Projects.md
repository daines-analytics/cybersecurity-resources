# Open Source Cybersecurity Projects

If you would like to work with me to build out your own projects based on what you want go to [upskilltocyber.com](http://upskilltocyber.com/) 

These are free resources/projects/tools to follow your curiosity and gain skills

## Networking

Networking quite simply is how data gets from one computer to another. A model that helps you understand how this is done, can be found here: [https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/osi-model/#:~:text=The Open Systems Interconnection](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/osi-model/#:~:text=The%20Open%20Systems%20Interconnection%20) (OSI,across%20geographical%20and%20political%20boundaries.

## Adversary Emulation

**Atomic Red Team** - https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team

**MITRE CALDERA** - https://github.com/mitre/caldera

Use AWS to simulate attack scenarios, where you will set up a miniature domain that includes a controller and a few host machines.  MITRE's CALDERA tool is quite efficient for automating such tests. It us to simulate credential theft scenarios using Mimikatz. The simulation starts from a point where an agent is already pre-installed on the target machine, which could be perceived as bending the rules of the simulation a bit.

Idea: 

1. Team member deploys crafted actions on the target host via CALDERA
2. Another team member tries to determine what the original team member did via tooling
3. Both team members compare notes and determine gaps in knowledge and visibility
4. Gaps and detection procedures are documented and shared via the knowledge management platform
